### **Teacher: Apostle Joshua**  
#### **Title: "The Role of Deacons and Deaconesses"**  

### **Origin of Deacons**  
- The word "Deacon" comes from the Latin word "Draconius."  
- Ignatius suggested appointing honest individuals to distribute food to the people.  

### **Qualifications of Deacons and Deaconesses**  
- Must serve God sincerely (1 Timothy 3:7).  
- Must avoid bars and ungodly behavior.  
- Must be faithful to one spouse.  

### **Responsibilities of Deacons and Deaconesses**  
- Support the General Overseer (G.O.).  
- Hold monthly or quarterly meetings with the G.O.  
- Dress corporately and appropriately.  
- Avoid gossip, slander, or discouraging members.  
- Avoid borrowing money irresponsiblyâ€”failure leads to disciplinary action.  
- Visit sick members and those absent from church.  
- Settle disputes before escalating to the G.O.  
- Allow the G.O. to restâ€”handle minor issues internally.  
- Mosesâ€™ father-in-law advised dividing ministry work to reduce stress (Exodus 18:3â€“26).  
- The G.O. can assign deacons and deaconesses to represent him at events.  
- Study regularly (2 Timothy 2:11â€“15) and own a Bible.  
- Lead prayers, preach, and moderate services.  
- Ensure the well-being of the G.O. as required.

### **Final Remarks**  
- Ordination is a sacred responsibility.  
- Those who are faithful will be blessed.  
- Be steadfast in Godâ€™s work without looking back.
