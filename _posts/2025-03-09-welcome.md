## Walking in Faith Every Day  

Faith is not just about believing—it’s about living a life that reflects trust in God’s promises. As the Bible says:  

> "For we walk by faith, not by sight." – 2 Corinthians 5:7  

### **3 Ways to Grow Spiritually**  
1. **Daily Prayer & Meditation** – Set aside time to talk to God.  
2. **Bible Study** – Strengthen your faith by reading the Word.  
3. **Fellowship with Others** – Engage in church activities and connect with believers.

Blessings,  
**Prophet Dr. Matthew Imoisi**
